==  Main objects  ==

Runtime
  Acts as intermediary between the client and the different mode handlers.
  Eventually in charge of the display and of threading.

Mode Handlers
  One for each mode: RUN, EVAL, LRN, LST_* etc.
  They handle key presses, next() for threading, and other client calls.

Parser
  Used by RUN, EVAL and LRN handlers to transform key presses and program steps
  into structured operations.

Evaluators
  One for each operation (lnx, sto, gto, ...). They transform the calculator
  state. Used in RUN and EVAL modes.

Logger
  Logs operations and their results.


==  Example of flow: lnx  ==

User presses lnx. Client calls Runtime:
    runtime.press(2, 3)
        eval_handler.press(2, 3)        // Assuming we are in EVAL mode.
            parser.press(2, 3)          // Get structured opn from key press.
            eval_opns()                 // lnx is the operation.
                lnx.eval()              // Let evaluator compute lnx of regX.
                logger.log_operation()  // Logging.
        display_mode = [  // Runtime controls display mode.
        return 0.1        // Threading: have client call next() in 0.1s.

Client calls next in 0.1s:
    runtime.next()
        display_mode = regX  // Replace "[" by result of lnx.
        return IDLE          // Assuming there is no error.
