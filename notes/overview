==  Main objects  ==

Runtime
  Handles threading and user events, and calls the appropriate mode handlers.

Mode Handlers
  One for each mode: RUN, EVAL, LRN, LST_* etc.
  They handle key presses, next() for threading), and other calls.

Parser
  Used by RUN, EVAL and LRN handlers to transform key presses and program steps
  into structured operations.

Operation Evaluators
  One for each operation (lnx, sto, gto, ...). They transform the calculator
  state. Used in RUN and EVAL modes.

Logger
  logs operations and their results


==  Example of flow  ==

User presses lnx and client calls:
    runtime.press(2, 3)
        eval_handler.press(2, 3)        // Assuming we are in EVAL mode.
            parser.press(2, 3)          // Get structure opn from key press.
            eval_opns()                 // lnx is the operation.
                lnx.eval()              // Let evaluator compute lnx of regX.
                logger.log_operation()  // Logging.
        display = "["  // Runtime in charge of display.
        return 0.1     // Threading: have client call next() in 0.1s.

Client calls next in 0.1s:
    runtime.next()
        display = regX  // Replace "[" by result of lnx.
        return IDLE     // Assuming there is no error.
