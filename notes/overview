Runtime
  Handles "threading" and user events, calling the appropriate mode handlers.

Mode Handlers
  One for each mode: RUN, EVAL, LRN, LST_* etc.
  They handle key presses and next() calls (threading).

Parser
  Used by RUN, EVAL and LRN handlers to transform key presses and program steps
  into structured operations.

Operation Evaluators
  One for each operation (lnx, sto, gto, ...). They transform the calculator
  state. Used in RUN and EVAL modes.
