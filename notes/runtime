Responsibilites:
- listening to key events including key releases.
- forwarding key presses
- animations
- tracing
- stoping
- advancing
- listing

Principles
- Modes: EVAL, LRN, RUN, LIST, ADVANCE, PROGRAM_LOAD, PROGRAM_SAVE
- Support "animations": key feedback, error blinking, pause, printing, tracing
- Be data/table based as much as possible.
- If 2 keys are fired in a row in eval/lrn mode, neither should be ignored.
- R/S should automatically stop any running program.

Options:
- key feedback: yes/no
  "Yes" is good for nostalgia reasons.
  "No" is better in practice and makes testing easier.

Non supported options:
- No error blinking option for monothreaded clients.
  Non supported as it complicates design.
  Instead provide blinking info to clients so they can decide not to animate.
- Classic behavior with no rapid fire, no auto stop options
  Non supported options as they complicate design.
  Rapid fire, auto stop are better behaviors anyway.
- Auto-release option when pressing a key before previous one has been released.
  Not an option as it complicates design.
  Instead clients should call key pressed followed by key release.
- Pause key animation in EVAL mode option.
  Not a feature as it complicates design.
  Anyway this is super minor.
