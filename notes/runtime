Responsibilites:
- listening to key press/release and other calls from client.
- forwarding calls to mode handlers.
- taking care of display and threading.

Principles
- Modes: EVAL, LRN, RUN, LIST, ADVANCE, PROGRAM_LOAD, PROGRAM_SAVE
- Support "animations": key feedback, error blinking, pause, printing, tracing
- Be data/table based as much as possible.
- If 2 keys are fired in a row in eval/lrn mode, neither should be ignored.
- R/S should automatically stop any running program.

Options:
- Feedback flag ("[")
  Feedback is the original TI-59 behavior.
  No feedback is useful as an option, in testing and monothreaded clients.
- Auto-release flag.
  With this option, a key press is immediately followed by a key release.
  Good for simple clients.
  Can't do tracing though or continuous advancing of paper.
- No blinking on error flag.
  Useful for monothreaded clients.

The following options are non supported as they complicate the design without
providing much.
- Classic behavior with no rapid fire, no auto stop options
- Pause operation animation in EVAL mode option.
