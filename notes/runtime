Principles
- Support all modes: EVAL, LRN, RUN, LIST, ADVANCE, PROGRAM_LOAD, PROGRAM_SAVE
- Support "animations": key feedback, error blinking, pause, printing, tracing
- Be data/table based as much as possible.
- If 2 keys are fired in a row in eval/lrn mode, neither should be ignored.
- R/S should automatically stop any running program.

Options:
- key feedback: yes/no
  "Yes" is good for nostalgia reasons.
  "No" is better in practice and makes testing easier.

Non supported options:
- No error blinking for monothreaded clients.
  Not an option as it complicates design.
  Instead provide blinking info to clients.
- Classic behavior with no rapid fire, no auto stop.
  Not an option as it complicates design.
  Rapid fire, auto stop are better behaviors. 
- Auto-release.
  Not an option as it complicates design.
  Instead clients should call key pressed followed by key release.
- Pause animation in EVAL mode.
  Not a feature as it complicates design.
