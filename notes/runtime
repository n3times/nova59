Responsibilites:
- listening to key press/release
- forwarding calls to mode handlers
- taking care of display and animations

Principles
- Modes: EVAL, LRN, RUN, LIST, ADVANCE, PROGRAM_LOAD, PROGRAM_SAVE
- Support "animations": key feedback, error blinking, pause, printing, tracing
- Be data/table based as much as possible.
- If 2 keys are fired in a row in eval/lrn mode, neither should be ignored.
- R/S should automatically stop any running program.

Options:
- key feedback ("["): yes/no
  Feedback is good for nostalgia reasons.
  No feedback is better in practice and makes testing easier.
- Auto-release
  With this option, a key press is immediately followed by a key release.
  Good for simple clients.
  Can't do tracing though or continuous advancing of paper.

Non supported options:
- No error blinking option for monothreaded clients.
  Non supported as it complicates design.
  Instead provide blinking info to clients so they can decide not to animate.
- Classic behavior with no rapid fire, no auto stop options
  Non supported options as they complicate design.
  Rapid fire, auto stop are better behaviors anyway.
- Pause key animation in EVAL mode option.
  Not a feature as it complicates design.
  Anyway this is super minor.
