==  Principles  ==

Log Types
  Trace  [ a full list of user/program input and output ]
    (NUM? (OPN RES))* (NUM_|OPN_)?
    Completed Input
      NUM: number                       [ 123    ]
      OPN: operation                    [ STO 45 ]
    Output
      RES: result from operation        [ 123.   ]
    Pending Input  (1 at most, at end of trace)
      NUM_: numbers in edit mode        [ 12     ]
      OPN_: pending operations [        [ STO 4_ ]
  EVAL Info [Also for SST | Trace]
    case last trace type:
      RES: last OPN
      OPN_: OPN_
      NUM_:
        AOS stack has no ops: n/a
        else: last OPN
  LRN Info


Modes
  EVAL and SST: log most user input and log results
  LRN: log nothing
  RUN: log pause, tracing and end final result (which is in EVAL)


==  Characters Needed for Tracing  ==

Ideally 31 but 27 is enough.

Operation:
  15 may be needed but uncommon: INV IFF *21 CLR
  11 would be generally OK: INV EXC *21
Display:
  14 characters  [ -8.8888888-88? ]
Spacing operation/display:
  2 characters

==  EVAL/SST  ==

* Numeric ops
  always numeric: 0 - 9, ., EE
  numeric if display in edit mode: +/-, INV EE
* Loggable ops
  Every op except numeric and program editing ops
* For loggable ops
  input: display if display in edit mode before operation
  input: operation
  output: display after operation


==  RUN mode  ==

* EVAL -> RUN: log op (but not display)
* RUN -> EVAL: log display/result (but not op)
* If op is "Pause", log op ("PSE") followed by display
* If trace, log the same way as in EVAL/SST
