FAITHFULNESS
* Parser should support all modes EVAL LRN RUN SST
* Nail RUN mode
* Treat RUN and SST identically for consistency
* Treat EVAL and LRN similarly if it simplifies design
* In EVAL and LRN mode, prioritize common sense and simplicity over faithfulness


USES
* Executing operations, change state in any mode
* Program listing
* Logging in RUN and EVAL modes


DIFFICULTIES
* Some keys/step are sometimes ignored: Nop, SST, Ind, 2nd, 2n'
* Lbl is not an operator but can be inside an operator: Ind Lbl A Lnx
* Pgm XX SBR address in RUN/SST modes
* SBR and inv SBR have different number of arguments. Same for Fix
* LRN, Ins, Del, BST take precedence over anything
* SST is its own beast: ignored or highest precedence
* Transitions between modes can be difficult
* What happens beyond last program step
