FAITHFULNESS
* Parser should support all modes EVAL LRN RUN SST
* Nail RUN mode
* Treat RUN and SST identically for consistency
* Treat EVAL and LRN identically if it simplifies design
* In EVAL and LRN mode, prioritize quality/simplicity over faithfulness


USES
* Program listing in RUN mode
* Logging in RUN and EVAL modes
* State change in any mode, including LRN


DIFFICULTIES
* Some keys/step are sometimes ignored: Nop, SST, Ind, 2nd, 2n'
* Lbl is not an operator but can be inside an operator: Ind Lbl A Lnx
* Pgm XX SBR address in RUN/SST modes
* LRN, Ins, Del, BST take precedence over anything
* SST is its own beast: ignored or highest precedence
* Transitions between modes are difficult
* What happens beyond last program step
