FAITHFULNESS
* Parser should support all modes: EVAL LRN RUN SST
* Nail RUN mode to best support original/legacy programs
* Treat RUN and SST identically for consistency
* In EVAL and LRN mode, consider common sense and simplicity over faithfulness

USES
* Produce operations that can be executed to change state in any mode
* Program listing
* Logging in RUN and EVAL modes

DIFFICULTIES
* Some keys/steps are sometimes ignored: Nop, SST, Ind, 2nd, 2n'
* Lbl is not an operator but can be inside an operator: Ind Lbl A Lnx
* Pgm XX SBR address in RUN/SST modes
* SBR and inv SBR have different number of arguments. Same for Fix
* LRN, Ins, Del, BST take precedence over anything
* SST is its own beast: ignored or highest precedence
* Transitions between modes can be difficult
* What happens beyond last program step

DESIGN
* Share parser state among modes.
* Share logic as much as possible, one main parse function, among modes.
* Have unit tests for every path/case.
